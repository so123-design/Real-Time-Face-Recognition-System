    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Real-Time Face Recognition System** is a project designed to detect and recognize faces in real-time using a webcam feed. This system leverages the power of computer vision and face recognition techniques to match live faces against a pre-stored database of images. The project is built using Python and integrates libraries such as `OpenCV` for image processing and `face_recognition` for facial encoding and matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates practical applications of face recognition in areas such as security, authentication systems, and personalized user experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Features**\n",
    "- **Face Detection**: Identifies human faces in real-time video feeds.\n",
    "- **Face Recognition**: Matches detected faces with pre-stored images and displays the recognized person's name.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Resizing**: Processes video frames efficiently by resizing for faster computation.\n",
    "- **Scalable Database**: Supports adding new individuals by simply placing their images in the `persons` folder.\n",

    "1. `cv2`: For real-time video capture and image processing.\n",
    "2. `numpy`: For numerical operations such as distance calculations.\n",
    "3. `face_recognition`: For encoding and matching faces.\n",

    "## **How It Works**\n",
    "1. **Setup**:\n",
    "   - Add images of individuals to the `persons` folder.\n",
    "   - Each image's filename should match the person's name.\n",
    "2. **Run the Program**:\n",
    "   - The program reads images, encodes faces, and prepares for recognition.\n",
    "3. **Recognition**:\n",
    "   - When a face is detected, it is compared against the stored encodings.\n",
    "   - If a match is found, the person's name is displayed.\n",
